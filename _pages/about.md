I am an Assistant Professor in the [MIT Math Deparment](http://math.mit.edu/). 
Previously I was a postdoc in the [Max-Planck Institute MiS](https://www.mis.mpg.de) working with [Prof. Bernd Sturmfels](https://math.berkeley.edu/~bernd/).
And before that I was at [MIT EECS](http://www.eecs.mit.edu), where I received my Ph.D. under the supervision of [Prof. Pablo Parrilo](http://www.mit.edu/~parrilo/).

My research interests include

* Mathematical optimization
* Computational algebraic geometry
* Their applications in sciences and engineering

<!--
I am co-organizing the seminar on [Algebra, Statistics, and Optimization](http://www.mit.edu/~diegcif/ASO) together with [Daniel Bernstein](https://dibernstein.github.io/).
