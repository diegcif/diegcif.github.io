I am an Assistant Professor in the [H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech.
My research centers around the development of mathematical optimization methods, and the application of these methods in engineering areas such as machine learning, statistics, robotics, power systems, and computer vision. I also work in the theoretical analysis of optimization methods, leveraging algebraic, geometric, and combinatorial information to improve efficiency and robustness.

Prior to joining ISyE, I was an applied math instructor in the [MIT Math Department](http://math.mit.edu/) and a postdoctoral researcher in the [Max Planck Institute MiS](https://www.mis.mpg.de).
I earned my Ph.D. and M.S. in the [MIT EECS Department](http://www.eecs.mit.edu) under the supervision of [Prof. Pablo Parrilo](http://www.mit.edu/~parrilo/).
<!-- , and my B.S. in Mathematics and B.S. in Electronics Engineering from Universidad de los Andes. -->


<!-- My research interests include -->
<!-- mathematical optimization, -->
<!-- computational algebraic geometry, -->
<!-- and their applications in sciences and engineering -->
