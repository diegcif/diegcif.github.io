We investigate the computational complexity of problems on toric ideals such as normal forms, Gröbner bases, and Graver bases. We show that all these problems are strongly NP-hard in the general case. Nonetheless, we can derive efficient algorithms by taking advantage of the sparsity pattern of the matrix.
