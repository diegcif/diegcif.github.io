We present an efficient algorithm to compute permanents, mixed discriminants and hyperdeterminants of structured matrices and multidimensional arrays.
We describe the sparsity structure of an array in terms of a graph, and we assume that its treewidth *ω* is small. 
Our algorithm requires *O(n 2^ω)* operations to compute permanents, and *O(n^2 + n 3^ω)* for mixed discriminants and hyperdeterminants.
Mixed volume computation remains NP-hard for bounded treewidth.
