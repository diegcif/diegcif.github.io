A [Macaulay2](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/Macaulay2/Packages/) package for taking advantage of graphical structure in polynomial ideals.
It comes pre-installed in Macaulay2 starting from version 1.11.
The package is based on the papers

* [Cifuentes-Parrilo (2016)](../publications/2016-ChordalStructure.html), *Exploiting chordal structure in polynomials ideals: A Gr√∂bner bases approach*
* [Cifuentes-Parrilo (2017)](../publications/2017-ChordalNetworks.html), *Chordal networks of polynomial ideals*
